# Angular-Standalone-Project-With-Firebase
Implemented a web app where you can store, fetch, or delete a recipe using a Firebase database. 
Added a shoppingList component where you can fetch and add ingredients from recipes to your shopping list.
Applied security measures such as authentication using guards.
Optimized the web app by making the components standalone and adding lazy loading.
Deployed it to Firebase (The unoptimised version), you can access it using the link: https://courseproject-a6046.web.app/shopping-list
